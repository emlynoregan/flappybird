## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone [repository-url]
   cd flappy
   ```

2. **Start a local server** (required for loading assets)
   ```bash
   # Python 3
   python -m http.server 8000
   
   # Python 2
   python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
   
   # Node.js
   npx http-server
   ```

3. **Open in browser**
   ```
   http://localhost:8000
   ```

## 🎮 How To Play

### **Controls**
- **Menu:** Click Play button or press SPACE/ENTER
- **Game:** Click, tap, or press SPACE to flap
- **Game Over:** SPACE to restart, ESC for menu

### **Gameplay**
- Guide the bird through pipe gaps by tapping to flap
- Score increases by 1 for each pipe successfully passed
- Difficulty increases every 5 points (faster pipes, smaller gaps, more frequent spawning)
- Avoid hitting pipes or the ground
- Try to beat your high score!

### **Difficulty Progression**
